# Disease-Surveillance
Overview
This project aims to monitor and predict the spread of diseases within wildlife populations, focusing on Asiatic lions in the Gir Forest. The primary disease studied is Canine Distemper Virus (CDV), and the project utilizes the SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model to simulate disease dynamics and predict its spread across the population. The project incorporates vaccination and quarantine strategies to manage outbreaks effectively.
In addition to the SIR model, a Disease Predictor is developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, which analyzes the risk level of disease outbreaks based on symptoms with varying severity levels. The system includes an interactive web-based interface where users can input symptoms and their severities, with the program predicting the likelihood of a disease outbreak and logging the results.
Technologies Used
Languages:
      C++: Used for implementing the core SIR model, disease prediction, and running simulations.
      JavaScript: Used for the development of the disease prediction systemâ€™s logic and interaction.
      HTML/CSS: Used for creating the interactive web-based interface for the disease predictor.
Features:-
    A)SIR Model Simulation
        Simulates the spread of Canine Distemper Virus (CDV) within the Asiatic lion population using the SIR model, considering factors like infection and recovery rates.
    B)Disease Prediction System
        Interactive Web Interface: Built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this interface allows users to input the number of symptoms, the severity of each symptom, and receive a prediction of the disease risk level.
        Risk Level Prediction: Based on user inputs, the system calculates the likelihood of a disease outbreak, categorizing it into different risk levels (low, moderate, high).
        Symptom Severity Encoding: Users can enter symptoms with varying levels of severity, and the system encodes these to predict disease risk accurately.
        Logging System: All predictions are logged with detailed information, including timestamps, user inputs, and predicted risk levels, for further analysis and tracking.
